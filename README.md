# yRCA
**yRCA** enables identifying the possible root causes for a (failure) event to happen in a service instance in a multi-service application, only based on the application logs.

## How to Run yRCA
**yRCA** provides a Python3-based command-line interface, which can be run with the following command:
```
python3 explain.py [OPTIONS] EVENT LOGS TEMPLATES
```
where
* `EVENT` is the path to the file containing the logged event that is to be explained (e.g., [event-edgeRouter.log](https://github.com/di-unipi-socc/yRCA/blob/main/data/examples/sock-echo/orders-fail/event-edgeRouter.log)),
* `LOGS` is the path to the file containing the logged events to be considered for explaining `EVENT`, viz., for finding the possible failure cascades causing `EVENT` to happen (e.g., [all.log](https://github.com/di-unipi-socc/yRCA/blob/main/data/examples/sock-echo/orders-fail/all.log)), and 
* `TEMPLATES` is the path to a YAML file specifying the templates for parsing logged events and assigning them with a type (e.g., [chaos-echo.yml](https://github.com/di-unipi-socc/yRCA/blob/main/data/templates/chaos-echo.yml))

By default, **yRCA** finds all possible explanations,  viz., the failure cascades that may have possibly caused `EVENT` to happen.
It then returns the possible explanations grouped based on their structure, and it ranks the returned explanation groups based on the frequency with which they occur).
**yRCA** can anyhow be configured with the available CLI `OPTIONS`, viz.,
* `-v` or `--vebose`, to run **yRCA** in verbose mode (viz., to not group identified explanations but rather return them plain),
* `-n N` or `--nSols=N`, to set the number `N` of possible explanations to identify, and
* `-r X` or `--rootCause X` to require `X` to be the root cause of identified explanations.

## How xFail Works

**yRCA** is composed of two main components, viz., the `parser` and the `explainer`, which are invoked in sequence by the main module (`explain`), which implements the command-line interface.

### The Parser
The `parser` provides a function `parse` for parsing a file `applicationLogs`, containing all events logged by all service instances in the considered run of a multi-service application. The function generates a representation of such logged events in Prolog, which is put in a given `knowledgeBase`. 

To enable parsing any type of log file, the `parser` exploits log templating, viz., it imports a `parse` function from the [templater](parser/templater) module. 
The latter implements all the logic needed to parse log events based on the input `TEMPLATES` (see above). 
Example of templates for the [Chaos Echo](https://github.com/di-unipi-socc/chaos-echo) benchmarking application can be found in [data/templates](data/templates)

Other templates can be provided for parsing the logs of other applications, provided that they are given as a YAML file structured as follows:
```
client_send: [list_of_regex]
client_receive: [list_of_regex]
client_error: [list_of_regex]
client_timeout: [list_of_regex]
server_receive: [list_of_regex]
server_send: [list_of_regex]
```

### The Explainer
The `explainer` essentially takes the Prolog representation of the input files generated by the parser and runs a Prolog query to identify the desired explanations. The latter is done by running the Prolog program [`explain.pl`](explainer/prolog/explain.pl), which provides all the rules for identifying the desired amount of explanations for a given event.
