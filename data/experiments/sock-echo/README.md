# Sock Echo Experiment
The *Sock Echo* experiment deploys, loads, and analyses the logs generated by a testbed application (obtained with [Chaos Echo](https://github.com/di-unipi-socc/chaos-echo)). 

## Sock Echo
The deployed application mirrors the topology of [Sock Shop](https://microservices-demo.github.io/), from which the name "Sock Echo".
It essentially consists of 14 interacting [Chaos Echo](https://github.com/di-unipi-socc/chaos-echo) services, configured to emulate the interactions between the services forming Sock Shop.

The [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file is specified so as to enable configuring the failure probability of 13 out of the 14 running services.
Those services correspond to the services whose failure can cause a (cascading) failure in `edgeRouter`, which is the service acting as frontend of the application.

**Experiments**

Measure accuracy (amount of returned solutions/explanations) and time performances of three different levels of instrumentation
1. no instrumentation (ids not logged by neither client nor server)
2. instrumented invocations (ids logged only by invokers)
3. instrumented interactions (ids logged by invokers and invokees)

**Howto**

Generate logs to be processed by versions 1-3 (same logs, different information considered).
1. varying MBs of logs (higher load per second, higher amount of logs) -> just one service failing, always "shipping" failing
    1. increasing end user load (fixed invoke probability)
        - 1 (1), 10 (0.1), 20 (0.05), 30 (0.033), 40 (0.025), 50 (0.02), 60 (0.0167), 70 (0.0143), 80 (0.0125), 90 (0.0111), 100 (0.01) -> rate (period between requests) 
    2. increasing invoke probability (fixed user load) -> 10 r/s
        - 1, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100
2. varying failing services (small amount of logs, to enable manually checking them)
    1. varying length of failure cascade
        - 1 (edgerouter-frontend), 2 (edgerouter-frontend-orders), 3 (edgerouter-frontend-orders-shipping), 4 (edgerouter-frontend-orders-shipping-rabbitmq)
    2. varying failure probability
        -  1, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100
